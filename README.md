## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**: [Flight Fare Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh). It includes the following features:

- **Airline**: Name of the airline.
- **Source**: Departure city.
- **Destination**: Arrival city.
- **Duration**: Flight duration.
- **Total_Stops**: Number of stops.
- **Price**: Target variable representing flight price.
- **Date_of_Journey**: The date of the journey, transformed into `Journey_day` and `Journey_month`.
- **Dep_time**: Split into `Dep_hour` and `Dep_min` to represent flight departure time.
- **Arrival_time**: Split into `Arrival_hour` and `Arrival_min` for flight arrival time.

---

## 🧠 Data Preprocessing

- **Null Value Handling**: Missing values were handled using imputation techniques, ensuring no information loss.
- **Outlier Detection**: Applied **IQR** to detect and remove price outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Key transformations included splitting date and time fields into more granular features like `Dep_hour`, `Arrival_hour`, `Journey_day`, and `Journey_month`.
